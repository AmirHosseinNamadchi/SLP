### Successive Linear Programming (SLP) algorithm

In the SLP technique, the solution of the original nonlinear programming
problem is obtained by solving a series of linear programming problems.
Each linear programming problem is generated by linearizing the
nonlinear objective and constraint functions about the current design
vector. This is done using Taylor's theorem for
multi-variable functions.
